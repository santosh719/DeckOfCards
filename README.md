# Deck Of Cards

Deck of Cards

52 cards with:

● 4 suits: hearts​, spades​, clubs​, diamonds

● Face values of: Ace​, 2-10​, Jack​, Queen​, and King​).

Within one of your classes, you must provide two operations:

shuffle()​ - shuffle returns no value, but results in the cards in the deck being randomly

permuted

dealOneCard()​ - returns one card from the deck to the caller. Specifically, a call to

shuffle() followed by 52 calls to dealOneCard() should result in the caller being provided

all 52 cards of the deck in a random order. If the caller then makes a 53rd call

dealOneCard(), no card is dealt.

## Usage
The test class contains the main method which can be called to test all the functionality
