# Deck Of Cards

Deck of Cards ( Design Problem)

52 cards with:

● 4 suits: hearts​, spades​, clubs​, diamonds

● Face values of: Ace​, 2-10​, Jack​, Queen​, and King​).



**shuffle**​() - shuffle returns no value, but results in the cards in the deck being randomly
permuted.

**dealOneCard**()​ - returns one card from the deck to the caller. Specifically, a call to
shuffle() followed by 52 calls to dealOneCard() should result in the caller being provided
all 52 cards of the deck in a random order. If the caller then makes a 53rd call
dealOneCard(), no card is dealt.
